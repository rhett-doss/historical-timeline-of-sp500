# S&P 500 Component History Builder

This repository showcases a Python-based solution designed to build a comprehensive historical view of the S&P 500 components. The script captures both the current constituents of the S&P 500 and its historical changes, sourced from Wikipedia and other datasets.

## Overview

### 1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**:
- Fetches the current S&P 500 list from Wikipedia.
- Retrieves historical changes in the S&P 500 components.
- Loads an existing dataset containing the historical view of S&P 500 components.

### 2. **Changes Data Formatting**:
- Processes the fetched changes data, grouping them by date and formatting for easy integration with the historical dataset.

### 3. **Historic Data Updates**:
- Uses the processed changes data to update the historical dataset, ensuring a continuous and accurate representation of the S&P 500 components over time.

### 4. **Corporate Actions Integration**:
- Incorporates corporate actions, such as mergers and splits, into the historical dataset, refining its accuracy.

### 5. **Main Execution**:
- Orchestrates the above processes in sequence and provides the final output: an updated and comprehensive historical view of the S&P 500 components.

## Note to Viewers

This repository and its code are intended purely as a showcase of the author's capabilities in data processing and manipulation in the finance domain. It is not designed for direct replication or production use. The primary goal is to demonstrate the approach and methods used to achieve the final result rather than to serve as a tool or library for external use.
